			OVR Utils is a VR overlay application that has some useful tools for SteamVR. It has been an ongoing project since may 2021.
		</p>
		<p>
			I wanted an overlay that could tell me the time without having to open the steam dashboard, and to see the battery levels of my controllers easily, but couldn't find one for free that also had linux support. So I decided to create my own, and also wrote down a long list of other useful tools. So far only a few of these have been implemented, such as the image overlay and the keyboard.

			I really like voxels so I decided to try making an algorithm that generates a triangle mesh for a set of voxels. It tries to minimise the number of triangles by merging quads.
