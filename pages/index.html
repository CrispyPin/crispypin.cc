		<h1>Hello!</h1>
		<p>Welcome to my corner of the internet. I use this page to showcase some of my interesting projects in an easier to see way compared to just github.</p>

			<p>
				I am making a voxel engine in rust to learn rust and godot-rust as well as explore voxel systems.

			<p>
				OVR Utils is a VR overlay application that has some useful tools for SteamVR. I have been working on it on and off since May 2021.
			</p>
			<p>
				I wanted an overlay that could tell me the time without having to open the steam dashboard, and to see the battery levels of my controllers easily, but couldn't find one for free that also had linux support. So I decided to create my own, and also wrote down a long list of other useful tools. So far only a few of these have been implemented, such as the image overlay and the keyboard.

			<h2><a href="/blender">Blender creations</a></h2>
			<p>I have been using Blender since around august 2020 on and off, and did a course in it 2021, which boosted my motivation a lot. I occasionally make art in it and of course use it for game jams.</p>

			While I was learning web development and javascript I made a page with fractals. I thought it was interesting enough to keep here.
