			<h1>Hey nerd</h1>
			<p>Welcome to my corner of the internet. I use this page to dump some of my less uninteresting projects.</p>
			<p>Basically everything is also on <a href="https://github.com/CrispyPin">GitHub</a> and all my (published)
				games are on <a href="https://crispypin.itch.io">itch.io</a></p>
			<p>My list of future projects is essentially infinite, because it grows at a rate of 2 per week and i only
				start like one thing every 2 weeks</p>

			<h2><a href="/voxels">Voxel engine in godot-rust</a></h2>

			<p>
				I made a voxel engine in rust to learn rust and godot-rust as well as explore voxel systems. It has
				(practically) infinite terrain generation, lets you place and remove voxels and supports transparent
				voxel types. The main point was to develop an optimised meshing algorithm.

			<a href="https://github.com/CrispyPin/ovr-utils">https://github.com/CrispyPin/ovr-utils</a>
			<p>
				OVR Utils is a VR overlay application that has some useful tools for SteamVR. I have been "working on
				it"
				on and off since May 2021.
			</p>
			<p>
				I wanted an overlay that could tell me the time without having to open the steam dashboard, and to see
				the battery levels of my controllers easily, but couldn't find one for free that also had Linux support.
				So I decided to create my own, and also wrote down a long list of other useful tools. So far only a few
				of these have been implemented, such as the image overlay and the keyboard.

			<h2><a href="/blender">Blender creations</a></h2>
			<p>I have been using Blender since around August 2020 on and off, and did a course in it 2021, which boosted
				my motivation a lot. I occasionally make art in it and of course use it for game jams.</p>
